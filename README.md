# Keck-Simulation-HCIPy
Keck AO simulations created by M van Kooten and C Bond

You can find here working examples of various Keck and Keck AO subsystems written in Python making use of HCIPy (https://hcipy.org). We have the following features implemented:
- Keck segemented aperture
- modulated pyramid wavefront sensor that matches the current NIR implementation
- working Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor that matches the specs of the Keck visible SHWFS
- Lyot stop modeled after the new install in 2018 that works with vortex coronagraph on Keck 2 and NIRC2

This code is written for HCIPy version 0.4.0. The code is not actively being maintained but periodic updates might happen or new features added. We might update to a newer HCIPy version in the future.
